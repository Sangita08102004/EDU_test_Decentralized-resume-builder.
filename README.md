# Decentralized Resume Builder

## Project Description
The Decentralized Resume Builder is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to buy, sell, and auction digital art as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Leveraging the power of smart contracts, this platform ensures transparency, security, and decentralization, enabling artists to directly connect with buyers and collectors.

The vision is to create a transparent, secure, and artist-friendly platform where digital art can be tokenized and traded without intermediaries. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform empowers creators with full control over their work, ensuring authenticity and provenance through NFTs.

## Future Scope
- Implement multi-chain support for broader accessibility.
- Integrate IPFS for decentralized storage of digital art.
- Introduce royalty mechanisms to ensure artists get paid for secondary sales.
- Develop community-driven governance for platform upgrades.
- Add social features to foster artist and collector communities.

## Key Features
